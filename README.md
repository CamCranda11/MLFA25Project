# Cameron's Song Recommendation Tool

This is the repository for my song recommendation web application built on a Random Forest model to recommend songs from a dataset of 1 million songs from Spotify, released between 2000 and 2023. This README acts as documentation for each session of work.

After consulting a few sources, I have elected to shift my model to a K-Means Clustering model as that would make my end goal more attainable. A Random Forest model could work in theory, but it would train heavily on user data which would not provide a complete project in time for the due date.
