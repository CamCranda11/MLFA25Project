# Cameron's Song Recommendation Tool

This is the repository for my song recommendation web application built on a Random Forest model to recommend songs from a dataset of 1 million songs from Spotify, released between 2000 and 2023. This README acts as documentation for each session of work.

# Session 1 - 10/29/25, 10:24 AM
Created repo and added this README

# Session 2 - 10/29/25, 10:29 AM
After consulting a few sources, I have elected to shift my model to a K-Means Clustering model as that would make my end goal more attainable. A Random Forest model could work in theory, but it would train heavily on user data which would not provide a complete project in time for the due date.

# Session 3 - 10/29/25, 12:00 PM
I have built my model and have a few example use cases. I have yet to implement a search option and it will require some tests in order to judge its accuracy. Current outlook is good.

# Session 4 - 10/30/25, 10:02 AM
I have added more features to my model and expanded my k yet again to create a more refined model. I plan to add a system to sort into genres after clustering to create a more organized output.
